Circuit limit- the range of stock for particular day has been fixed within the circuit 
What are circuit limits or price bands?

Circuit limits, or price bands, are safeguards that exchanges set to prevent large price movements in instruments within very short timeframes. When an instrument's price hits the upper or lower circuit limit set by the exchange, your orders will remain pending at that circuit price for that particular stock, ETF, or contract (EQ, FNO, CDS or MCX).

How price bands work
The price band determines the price range within which you can trade a stock for that day. Circuit limits range from 2% to 20%, depending on the liquidity, volume, and category of stocks. You can find the upper and lower circuit limits for any instrument in the market depth on Kite.
